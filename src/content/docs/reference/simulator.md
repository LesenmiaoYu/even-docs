The simulator (`v0.6.2`) lets you preview UI layouts and test logic without physical hardware. It is a supplement to — not a replacement for — hardware testing.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @evenrealities/evenhub-simulator
```

> **npm:** [@evenrealities/evenhub-simulator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@evenrealities/evenhub-simulator) — cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)

## Usage

```bash
evenhub-simulator [OPTIONS] [targetUrl]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-c`, `--config <path>` | Path to config file (use `--print-config-path` to see the default) |
| `-g`, `--glow` | Enable glow effect on glasses display |
| `--no-glow` | Disable glow effect (overrides config) |
| `-b`, `--bounce <type>` | Bounce animation type: `default` or `spring` |
| `--list-audio-input-devices` | List available audio input devices |
| `--aid <device>` | Choose a specific audio input device |
| `--no-aid` | Use default audio device (overrides config) |
| `--print-config-path` | Print the default config file path and exit |
| `--completions <shell>` | Generate shell completions: `bash`, `elvish`, `fish`, `powershell`, `zsh` |
| `-V`, `--version` | Print version |
| `-h`, `--help` | Print help |

## Default Config File Paths

| Platform | Location |
|---|---|
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `$HOME/.config` |
| macOS | `$HOME/Library/Application Support` |
| Windows | `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}` (e.g., `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming`) |

## Audio

The simulator emits `audioEvents` with the following specification:
- Sample rate: 16,000 Hz
- Format: signed 16-bit little-endian PCM
- 100ms of data per event (3,200 bytes / 1,600 samples)

## Screenshot (v0.5.0+)

The simulator supports exporting the glasses display as an RGBA PNG file. Upon clicking the screenshot button, it exports to your current working directory with a timestamp-based filename. The file path is logged to both the simulator stdout and the glasses web inspector console.

The screenshot is not affected by the glow flag — that is a visual post-processing effect only.

## Caveats

- **Display rendering** may not perfectly match hardware (font rendering, greyscale levels). Sufficient for layout validation and logic testing.
- **List scrolling** behavior (focused-item positioning) can differ from real glasses.
- **Image processing** is faster and does not enforce hardware size limits.
- **Events:** Status events are not emitted (user/device profiles are hardcoded). Supported inputs: Up, Down, Click, Double Click.
- **Error handling** may differ from hardware under abnormal conditions.

Always validate on actual hardware before deployment. If you find discrepancies that affect logic, please file a bug report in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/Y4jHMCU4sv).
